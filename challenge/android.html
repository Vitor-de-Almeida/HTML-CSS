            <h1>
                Android Mascot History
            </h1>

            <p>
                You probably know that the <strong>Android</strong> operating system, maintained by <strong>Google</strong>, is one of the most used for mobile devices around the world. But perhaps you don't know that your friendly mascot has a very curious name and story? Well, follow this article to learn a lot about this little robot.
            </p>

            <h2>
                The first version
            </h2>

            <p>The first attempt to create a mascot appeared in 2007 and came from a developer named <a href="https://androidcommunity.com/dan-morrill-shows-us-the-android-mascot-that-almost-was-20130103/" target="_blank">Dan Morrill</a>. He says he opened <a href="https://inkscape.org/pt-br/" target="_blank">Inkscape</a> (free software for vectorizing images) and created his own version of the robot. The objective was just to personify the system for its team only, there was no request from the company to create a mascot.</p>

            <p>
                This first bizarre version was even named after its creator: the <strong>Dandroids</strong>.
            </p>

            <h2>
                A new mascot appears
            </h2>

            <p>
                The idea of aving a mascot matured and the mission was passed on to a professional in the field. Russian illustrator <a href="https://www.irinablok.com/" target="_blank">Irina Blok</a>, also a Google employee, was tasked with representing the little robot in a more pleasant way.

            <p>
                Irina's main idea was to represent everything graphically with few strokes and in a flatter way. The design should also generate quick identification with those who look at it. Then <strong>Bugdroid</strong> appeared, Android's new mascot.
            </p>

            <img src="imagens/bugdroid.png" alt="Bugdroid">

            <p>
                The main inspiration for the new <strong>Bugdroid's</strong> features came from those little dolls that illustrate bathroom doors to indicate the gender of each door. Legend has it that the artist was creating at her desk in the <strong>Google</strong> office and looked towards the bathrooms and the identification was immediate: simple, clean, objective.

                    Another curious issue regarding Android is that each version has always been named after a sweet, in alphabetical order from version 1.5 to 9.0.

                <p>
                    Unfortunately, <strong>Android Q</strong> did not exist, as Google decided to put an end to this fun practice and started using numbering, which gave rise to Android 10.
